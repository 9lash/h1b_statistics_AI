Input Dataset
Raw data could be found here under the Disclosure Data tab (i.e., files listed in the Disclosure File column with ".xlsx" extension). For your convenience we converted the Excel files into a semicolon separated (";") format and placed them into this Google drive folder. However, do not feel limited to test your code on only the files we've provided on the Google drive
